# rgb_js_example
This is the first and only script I've (Coleman) written in JavaScript <br />
But not the last.  Now that Nick Mileson (PNNL) has helped with deployment of nodejs qith express and bootstrap.
More Javascript apps will be developed in the future.

Add this code to your ../bootstrap-master/public/  direcotry.
Don't forget the css page  (rgb.css)  Place the rgb.css file in the ../bootstrap-master/public/stylesheets/ directory.
